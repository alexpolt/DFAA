## DFAA Antialiasing Algorithm

This repository contains two HLSL SM3.0 shaders that provide the most basic
implementation of the DFAA algorithm. More info could be found in the 
[blog post ](http://alexpolt.github.io/dfaa.html).

In the bin directory there is a DirectX9 standalone demo. But advise you 
to better use the provided RenderMonkey project (in the RenderMonkey folder). 
There you will find knobs on the right to have better control over DFAA.
