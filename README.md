## DFAA Antialiasing Algorithm

This repository contains two HLSL SM3.0 shaders that provide the most basic
implementation of the DFAA algorithm. More info could be found in the 
[blog post ](http://alexpolt.github.io/dfaa.html).

In the bin directory there is a tiny sample DirectX9 standalone application 
(just windows exe file). It's free of any viruses and doesn't touch any files or sockets.
