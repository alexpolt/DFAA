##RenderMonkey project

This is a RenderMonkey project that demonstrates the DFAA Antialiasing Algorithm.
I've copy-pasted an adaptation of FXAA from <http://stackoverflow.com/a/7735547/1708247>.
I doesn't seem to work (only visible on high-contrast pixels), so I need to work on that.

On the right you have **artist variables** that you can tweak. 
There are boolean knobs named **"rotate"** (that's to auto rotate the model) and
**DFAA** (controls whether or not DFAA is on) and FXAA (FXAA doesn't seem to work).
