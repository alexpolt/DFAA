##RenderMonkey project

This is a RenderMonkey project that demonstrates the DFAA Antialiasing Algorithm.
I've copy-pasted an adaptation of FXAA from <http://stackoverflow.com/a/7735547/1708247>.
I doesn't seem to work (only visible on high-contrast pixels), so I need to work on that.

On the right you have **artist variables** that you can tweak:

* uv01colors - high contrast coloring using provided 01 uv's
* rotate - auto rotate the model
* DFAA
* FXAA (DFAA has priority if both are on)
