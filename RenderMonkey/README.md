##RenderMonkey project

This is a RenderMonkey project that demonstrates the DFAA Antialiasing Algorithm.
I've copy-pasted an adaptation of FXAA from <http://stackoverflow.com/a/7735547/1708247>.
By checking checkboxes on the right you can clearly see the difference between the two methods.

On the right of the RenderMonkey UI you have **artist variables**:

* uv01colors - high contrast coloring using provided 01 uv's
* rotate - auto rotate the model
* DFAA
* FXAA (DFAA has priority if both are on)
