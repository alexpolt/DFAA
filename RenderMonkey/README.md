##RenderMonkey project

This is a RenderMonkey project that demonstrates the DFAA Antialiasing Algorithm.

On the right you have **artist variables** that you can tweak.

There are two boolean knobs named **"rotate"** (that's to auto rotate the model) and
**DFAA** (controls whether or not DFAA is on).
